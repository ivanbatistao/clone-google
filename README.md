# Google clone

This project was done as part of my practice of HTML & CSS. I used semantic HTML5, CSS3 (you'll see a bit of flex and grid), Git and VSCode.

Go and see how this Google clone looks by clicking [here](https://ivanbatistao.github.io/google-clone/).

You can also go and check the [HTML document](https://ivanbatistao.github.io/google-clone/) and [CSS document](https://ivanbatistao.github.io/google-clone/).

Thanks for taking the time to check this project.

All feedback is welcome!

**NOTE:** This project was partially guided by [Platzi](http://platzi.com). By partially guided I mean that I took the course - called [Curso practico de HTML y CSS](https://platzi.com/clases/html-practico/) - and tried to do everything (header, main & footer sections) on my own before watching the video(s). After watching the video for each section, I compared what I did for that section I was working on with what was done by the person in the video. When I was stuck I went to the video and watched it.
